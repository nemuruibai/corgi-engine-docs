## Introduction

Creating moving platforms in the Corgi Engine is very simple, yet there are a lot you can do with them, and a lot of ways to tweak them to your unique needs. For examples of moving platforms, you can check the right end of the FeaturesPlatforms demo level, it shows a few examples of what you can achieve.

## Creating a moving platform

To create a moving platform, simply follow these simple steps :

*   Start by dragging a sprite in your scene, or a 3D model
*   Select your newly created game object, and set its layer to “MovingPlatforms”
*   Add a non trigger BoxCollider2D to it
*   Add a Rigidbody2D component to it
*   Add a MovingPlatform component to your object.
*   You’re done! All that’s left to do is tweaking the MovingPlatform’s component’s inspector.

## Setting up moving Platforms

From the MovingPlatform’s inspector, there are a few things you can tweak.

First of all there’s the Path, which is the list of points the platform will go through. You can first decide on a Cycle Option. You can select Back and Forth (it’d go 1 > 2 > 3 > 2 > 1 > 2 etc), Loop (1 > 2 > 3 > 1 > 2…), and Only Once (1 > 2 > 3). Then there’s the loop initial movement direction, which depending on your choice will start the movement either with the first (ascending) or last (descending) point in the path. And then of course there’s the actual Path Elements where you’ll need to specify an array’s size. From there, you can either enter the points coordinates, or simply drag and position the little handles that appeared next to your platform to the position of your choice.

Positioning a moving platform's path elements

Once you’re happy with their placement, you can go back to the inspector, and set the movement’s speed and acceleration type. The MinDistanceToGoal field is best left to its default value but feel free to change it if necessary. Lastly, you can decide on a few Activation settings, allowing your platform to only move when a Player collides with it, and whether or not it should reset position. You can also decide your platform is script activated, which is particularly useful for key operated platforms/doors.

## One Way Moving Platforms

Creating a one-way moving platform (meaning a moving platform you can jump through from underneath, or jump off down) is super simple. Just repeat the same process (or select an already created moving platform) and set its layer to “MovingOneWayPlatforms”.
